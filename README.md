# Eleven - Node.js protocol-agnostic framework

## Ideas
- locals like username account-domain added automatically (headers? requestSpec?)
- broadcasting, http-req/http-res, fire and forget, http-req/http-req, queue/queue, combinations, multi sources and sinks,

## Todo
- authentication and authorization, JWT, OAuth2,
- unify api for http, ws and queues,
- check usage of channels,
- what about routing and headers? Should we use them? header Authorization??
- what about database access? datalog? datomic?
